# Breast Cancer Cell Prediction

Welcome to the Breast Cancer Cell Prediction project! This project features a machine learning model developed to classify breast cancer cells as malignant or benign based on various cell features.

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a machine learning model using various cell features to classify breast cancer cells as malignant or benign. The model's performance is evaluated using key metrics such as confusion matrix, classification report, prediction distribution, and class distribution charts.

## Source Code

You can access the source code for this project on GitHub: [Breast Cancer Cell Prediction Source Code](https://lnkd.in/eubSMHqX)

## Web App

Explore the model's performance using the interactive web app. The web app allows you to visualize the model's performance through various charts and metrics.
